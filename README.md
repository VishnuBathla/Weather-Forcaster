# Weather Forecaster

## Motivation

- If you live in nothern part of India, close to Delhi, you must have experienced quite hot climate.
- Some days are so hot and dry that I feel quite drowsy whole day long.
- So I motivated myself to do a mini-project as an excuse to get more hands-on with Python and get a weather forecast without having to browse too much :)
- And that's how this project came to life!
